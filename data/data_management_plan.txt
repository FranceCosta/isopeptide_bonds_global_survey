*Data Management Plan*

Francesco Costa, 01/11/2024

**What types of research data are you working with?**

Protein structure data in PDB formats, tabular data in CSV format.

**What is your strategy for organising your data?**

Input files, subproject directories and jupyter notebooks are named following this naming convention:
“<date in YYYYMMDD format>_<name>_<version>”

The project directory contains the following subdirectories:
-	“analysis” contains subprojects. Each contains “input”, “output” and code (named “bin” or and “sh”) to store input data, output files and code. A “README.md” file explaining the purpose of the subproject and relevant notes is present as well.
-	Each subproject may additionally contain jupyter notebooks used for data analysis within the context of the subproject.
-	“bin” contains code in python shared throughout the project.
-	“data” contains input data and a “README.md” file explaining the content of each file. 
-	“notebooks” contains data analysis jupyter notebooks.
-	“output” contains code-generated output files.
-	“sh” contains bash scripts.
-	“.env” is a file which contains code variables used throughout the project.
-	“README.md” is a file which contains relevant information about the project.
-   Each directory can contain a subdirectory “deprecated” to store old files not in use anymore.

**What is your data backup strategy?**

The entire project is stored at the EBI computer cluster and backed up regularly.
All the files except output files that can be easily reproduced by via code execution are regularly backed up in a private repository which will be made publicly available upon preprint publication.
Large data will be made available in a public repository (i.e. Zenodo) upon publication of the preprint. 

**How do you exchange files (and other information) with your collaborators?**

Through google drive.

**Are you working with commercial/sensitive/personal/patentable data? Will you be able to share these data?**

No.
