# Download and format positive and negative datasets

- Positive control derived from DATA
- Negative control 1: `QUERY: ( Enzyme Classification Name = "Transferases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Hydrolases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Oxidoreductases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Lyases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Isomerases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Ligases" OR Enzyme Classification Name = "Translocases" ) AND Parent Scientific Name (typically superkingdom or clade) = "Eukaryota" AND Refinement Resolution <= 1.5` and in addition selecting representative 30% identity; consisitin in 765 structures (only 727 succesfully downloaded);
- Negative control 2: `QUERY: Parent Scientific Name (typically superkingdom or clade) = "Eukaryota" AND Refinement Resolution <= 1.5 AND Polymer Entity Sequence Length > 20 AND ( Component Identifier = "CL" OR Component Identifier = "CU" OR Component Identifier = "FE" OR Component Identifier = "MO" OR Component Identifier = "PO4" OR Component Identifier = "SO4" OR Component Identifier = "CD" OR Component Identifier = "ZN" ) AND Component Identifier NOT = "DNA" AND Component Identifier NOT = "RNA"` and in addition selecting 30% identity consisiting in 833 protein structures succesfully donloaded
- Negative control 3: `QUERY: Data Collection Resolution <= 1.5 AND Parent Scientific Name (typically superkingdom or clade) = "Eukaryota" AND Polymer Entity Sequence Length > 80` and in addition selecting 30% identity (query saved to `input/20241204_RSCB_search.txt`) consisiting in --- protein assemblies succesfully donloaded;
